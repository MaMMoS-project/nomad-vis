def _get_attrs(name, obj):
    """
    Extracts attributes from an HDF5 dataset object and stores them in global variables.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name : str
        Name of the HDF5 dataset, used as key for storing attributes.
    obj : h5py.Dataset
        HDF5 dataset object from which attributes are extracted.

    Notes
    -----
    If `obj` is an instance of `h5py.Dataset`, its data is stored in the `attrs`
    dictionary with `name` as the key. If the dataset has a "units" attribute,
    it is also stored in the `units` dictionary.

    Reads XRD results from an HDF5 file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hdf5_file : str or pathlib.Path
        The path to the HDF5 file containing the data to be extracted.
    group_path : str or pathlib.Path
        The path within the HDF5 file to the group where the data is located.
    result_type : str
        The name of the result you want to retrieve. If the result is not found, the function returns 1.

    Returns
    -------
    parent_attrs : dict
        A dictionary containing the XRD results. The keys are the names of the results and the values are dictionaries with the keys "data" and "units".
    xrd_units : dict
        A dictionary containing the units of the XRD results. The keys are the names of the results and the values are the corresponding units.

    -----
    If the result is not found, the function returns 1.
